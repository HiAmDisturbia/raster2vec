# raster2vec
raster2vec is a plugin for QGIS, that transforms a raster image into a vector image, using the algorithms of L0 Cut-Pursuit and Potrace Multi-Labels. Credits goes to Hugo Raguet, aka 1a7r0ch3, who created these algorithms. They can be found here:

[Potrace Multi-Labels](https://gitlab.com/1a7r0ch3/multilabel-potrace "Potrace Multi-Labels")

## How to install the plugin:
### Windows

Download the ZIP file of the entire raster2vec project. Extract the files from the zip file, copy the raster2vec folder, then paste it to:
`C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins`

`user_name` takes the name of your account on windows. As for `QGIS3`, if you are using another version of QGIS that is 2.X, the folder name would be QGIS2, but the paths would be the same.

_The text will be updated conforming to the codes added, to explain it to the user before he/she downloads the project_
